                Once respondents have finished answering the survey on submitting their answers
                the survey can be set to trigger a "completion action" at the end of the survey. <br /><br />
                Available actions:<br />
                <br />
                <b>&quot;Thank you&quot; Message</b><br />
                <br />
                This will show a message (created with the text/html editor) to the respondent once the survey
                is finished and submitted. It could be used to thank the user or possibly provide some information
                about the survey taken. <br />

                and when the update button is clicked the text will be assigned to the selected
                language.<br />
